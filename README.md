This repository contains a Node.js script that utilizes Puppeteer, a headless Chrome browser automation library, to scrape data from Shopee, an e-commerce platform. The scraped data, such as product names, prices, and ratings, is then saved to a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file for further analysis or usage.
